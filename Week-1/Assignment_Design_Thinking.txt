My team start's with planning out the main objectives of this project that is firstly that we go for the area,
where this project of intersection of roads to be made in this project we have to consider this points a public transportation stop,
bicycle lane, zebra crossing, proper traffic signals and most importantly a proper time management system
We start the the solving the problem of heavy vehicles and four wheeler are to be 
separated from bicycle and bike riders so we can reduce the chances of accidents then there should be a footpath 
for pedestrians and the most important zebra crossing with good accuracy of traffic signals for maximum safety of pedestrian. 
If we face heavy traffic situation during college and school hours we can go for a flyover bridge for pedestrians so we don't have to manage 
time in between pedestrians and traffic after that we can provide a constant single without a time system so that traffic didn't rush is last few seconds.
For the public transportation we have to provide a separate public transportation stop in both 
the intersecting roads so people can easily reach and save there time.
